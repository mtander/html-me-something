                <p>Mirroring is the natural human tendency to unconsciously mimic 
                    another person's movement, tone, facial expressions, and speech.
                    Couples, friends, and business partners frequently mirror in order
                    to be "in synch" with the other person.  This phenomenon has been
                    captured in many photographs:</p>

                <p>Most people's natural impulse is to spend a conversation or 
                interaction planning out what they will say.  Especially in a 
                negotiation scenario, where stakes are higher, it's too easy
                to tune in to our emotions (specifically stress due to loss
                aversion) and too easy to miss all the information you could be
                getting from your counterpart.</p>
